# Name-generator
Python script that allows you to generate random names. It's pretty small and it's all annotated, so you're easily able to modify it to your own needs. I hope you enjoy it <3

# How to use it?
When the script starts, you're given the option of picking between two modes (usernames and real names).

### Username mode
Username mode is useful if you're just looking for usernames instead of real names. You're given the option of choosing between few and mass generate. Few mode is useful if you only need a few names. Mass generate mode is useful if you're trying to mass generate a bunch of fake names that are all saved to a text file named 'names.txt'.

### Real names mode
Real names mode works in a very similar way to username mode, but instead of usernames, you're given real names. You're given the option of choosing between few and mass generate. Few mode is useful if you only need a few names. Mass generate mode is useful if you're trying to mass generate a bunch of fake names that are all saved to a text file named 'names.txt'.
