# Name-generator
Python script that allows you to generate random names.

You're able to generate a random name and then add numbers to it as well. 

## How to use it?

You'll be asked whether you want a short name or a long name. Short names are a prefix and a root while long names are a prefix, a root, and a suffix. 

You'll also be asked whether or not you want to add numbers to it. The script loops until you're satisfied with the name you received. This script is pretty small and it's all annotated, so you're easily able to modify it to your own needs.

I hope you enjoy it <3
