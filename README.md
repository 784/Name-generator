# Name-generator
Python script that allows you to generate random names. It's pretty small and it's all annotated, so you're easily able to modify it to your own needs. I hope you enjoy it <3

# How to use it?
When the script starts, you're given the option of picking between two modes (usernames and real names).

### Username mode
Username mode is useful if you're just looking for usernames instead of real names. You're given the option of choosing between few and mass generate. Few mode is useful if you only need a few names. Mass generate mode is useful if you're trying to mass generate a bunch of fake names that are all saved to a text file named 'names.txt'.

### Real names mode
Real names mode works in a very similar way to username mode, but instead of usernames, you're given real names. You're given the option of choosing between few and mass generate. Few mode is useful if you only need a few names. Mass generate mode is useful if you're trying to mass generate a bunch of fake names that are all saved to a text file named 'names.txt'.

# GUI version

There's also a GUI version of the script that I made. It does the exact same thing as the text based one, but it's a lot easier to use if you're a new user. When you click a button, a popup comes up telling you your name. If you're mass generating names, there's a textbox. You can enter the amount of names that you want to generate. Once you click the button of the type of names you want, they'll be saved to a text file named 'names.txt'. A popup window also comes up telling you where they're saved incase you forget!
